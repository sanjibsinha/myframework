# myframework
An MVC PHP 7 framework with PDO support, keeping 'separation of concerns' and 'single class responsibility'
# This is a code repository for my book: How to Build a PHP 7 Framework
## It is available in Amazon and Leanpub
## It is assumed that you have a table called "users" and two columns over there - id and name.
Just fill in with some data and try in your browser like this:
http://localhost/mymvc/public/1
## It will give you the user name.
That is it!
A very simple PHP MVC framework on top of that you can build your own application by adding more packages.
