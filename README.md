# mymvc
A Simple PHP framework with PDO support
## It is assumed that you have a table called "users" and two columns over there - id and name.
Just fill in with some data and try in your browser like this:
http://localhost/mymvc/public/1
## It will give you the user name.
That is it!
A very simple PHP MVC framework on top of that you can build your own application by adding more packages.
